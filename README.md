Finds the minimum point of the crosstray function using a Particle Swarm approach.

Particles try to find a possible random solution and as the converge towards a better point, a local optima, by changing their position (solution) they update their velocity if they do not go out of the seach space. Otherwise they reset their velocity in order to be kept within the seach space.
